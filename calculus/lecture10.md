# 最值问题
f(x) = (x+1)/(x+2), x != 2

## Plots
f((-2)⁺) = -∞

f((-2)⁻) = ∞

## Ends

x -> ∞, x -> -∞

f(x) = (1+1/x)/(1+2/x)

f(∞) -> 1

## General Strategy for Sketching

1. Plot:
    - discontinuity(specials in finite)
    - end points(or x -> ∞)
    - easy points(optional)
2.
    - solve f'(x) = 0
    - plot the critical points and values
3. Decide whether f' is positive or negative on each interval between critical points/discontinuity.
4. Observe f'' is positive or negative to decide whether it is concave up or down(函数的凹凸性), f''(0) -> inflection points(拐点)

Example:

f(x) = x/lnx, x > 0

## Maximum and Minimum

KEY: ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT CRITICAL POINTS AND END POINTS AND POINTS OF DISCONTINUITY.
